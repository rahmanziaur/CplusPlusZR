## 0. Before the First Class — Setup Checklist

Complete all steps below **before** the first lab session. You will demonstrate your working setup in class and be awarded **5 marks**, added to your Lab Test score.

1. **Install Ubuntu (26.04.1 LTS)** on your system.

5. **Write and run your first program.** Open VS Code in Ubuntu, copy-paste the program below, and run it. Once it works, push the file (`helloworld.cpp`) to your repository using Git from the terminal.

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;

   int main() {
       cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
       return 0;
   }
   ```

> **Note:** In the first class, your GitHub repository will be checked directly on your Ubuntu machine. Make sure setup is complete beforehand.

## 1. Course Rationale

This lab complements the theory course in Object‑Oriented Programming and builds **hands‑on, industry‑relevant C++ programming skill** — not rote theory. Every session is structured as: *short concept demo → guided coding → independent lab test → take‑home reinforcement*, culminating in a live‑coded final project and a GitHub‑hosted portfolio.

## 2. Course Outcomes (CO) — Outcome Based Education

| CO No. | Course Outcome Statement | Bloom's Level | Skill Focus |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CO1** | Implement core object‑oriented building blocks in C++ (classes, objects, member functions, access control, static members) to write modular, well‑encapsulated code. | Apply (L3) | Foundational coding |
| **CO2** | Construct and manage object lifecycle correctly using constructors, destructors, overloading, and initialization techniques, including resource‑safe design. | Apply (L3) | Resource/lifecycle mgmt. |
| **CO3** | Analyze and design class hierarchies using inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and interfaces to solve multi‑class problems. | Analyze (L4) | OOP design |

## 5. Weekly Lab Test Format
Each 15–20 minute test (immediately after the session) contains:
- **1 short conceptual question** (5 marks worth, scaled) — verifies understanding of that day's topic.
- **1 hands‑on coding task** — write/complete/debug a short C++ program using the day's concept.
- Closed-book, IDE allowed, no internet except official cppreference.

---

## 6. Final Project (Course Project)
**Assigned:** Week 12 · **Presented:** Week 15

**Requirement:** Build a mid‑sized console (or simple client‑server) C++ application that demonstrably uses **at least 8 topics** from the course (must include inheritance, polymorphism, exception handling, file I/O, and one of: templates/threading/sockets).

**Examples:** Library Management System, Bank Account Simulator, Student Result Processor with file persistence, Simple Chat App using sockets, Inventory System with multithreaded stock updates.

**Submission:** GitHub repository (public or shared with instructor) containing source code, README, and a short demo video/screens.

---

## 7. Lab Report Requirements
Each student maintains a **GitHub repository** for the course containing:
1. One folder per week with source code (`.cpp`/`.h`) and a topic-specific `README.md` explaining the concept, code walkthrough, and sample output.
2. A master `README.md` (this style) summarizing weekly progress and linking to each week's folder.
3. A **handwritten, hand-scanned PDF** lab notebook (algorithm/flow, hand-traced code, output) uploaded weekly as `labnotes_weekX.pdf`.
