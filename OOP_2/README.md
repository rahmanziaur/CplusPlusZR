Lecture 01: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Using C++

Definition: 
OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which 
can contain data and methods.

Key Concepts:
➡️ Class: Blueprint for creating objects.
➡️ Object: Instance of a class.
➡️ Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods within a class.
➡️ Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details.
➡️ Inheritance: Deriving new classes from existing ones.
➡️ Polymorphism: Ability to process objects differently based on their 
data type or class.
```


**Lecture 02: Creating Classes and Objects**
```
Syntax
class ClassName {

    // Access specifiers: private, public, protected

    private:
        // Data members
    public:
        // Member functions
};
int main() {
    ClassName objectName; // Creating an object
    return 0;
}
```

**Lecture 03: Creating Class Member Functions**
```
Definition: Functions defined inside a class.

Syntax:

class ClassName {
private:
    int data;
public:
    void setData(int d) {
        data = d;
    }
    int getData() {
        return data;
    }
};
```
**Lecture 04: Input and Output Methods in Classes**

```
Example:


#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Student {
private:
    string name;
    int age;
    int marks;

public:
    void input() {
        cout << "Enter student's name: ";
        getline(cin, name);
        cout << "Enter student's age: ";
        cin >> age;
        cout << "Enter student's marks: ";
        cin >> marks;
        cin.ignore();
    }

    void output() const {
        cout << "Student's Name: " << name << endl;
        cout << "Student's Age: " << age << endl;
        cout << "Student's Marks: " << marks << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Student student;
    student.input();
    student.output();
    return 0;
}

```

**Lecture 05: Setter and Getter function**
```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Rectangle {
private:
    double width;
    double height;

public:
    void setWidth(double w) {
        width = w;
    }
    double getWidth() const {
        return width;
    }
    
    void setHeight(double h) {
        height = h;
    }
    double getHeight() const {
        return height;
    }
    
    double getArea() const {
        return width * height;
    }
    
    double getPerimeter() const {
        return 2 * (width + height);
    }
};

int main() {
    Rectangle rect;
    rect.setWidth(5.0);
    rect.setHeight(3.0);
    cout << "Width: " << rect.getWidth() << endl;
    cout << "Height: " << rect.getHeight() << endl;
    cout << "Area: " << rect.getArea() << endl;
    cout << "Perimeter: " << rect.getPerimeter() << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Lecture 06: Access Specifiers (Private, Public, Protected)**
```
Private: Accessible only within the class.
Public: Accessible from outside the class.
Protected: Accessible within the class and its derived classes.
```

**Lecture 07: Constructor in C++**
```
Definition: Special member function that initializes objects.
Syntax:

class ClassName {
public:
    ClassName() {
        // Constructor code
    }
};
```


**Lecture 08: Destructor in C++**
```
Definition: Special member function that cleans up when an object goes
out of scope.
Syntax:

class ClassName {
public:
    ~ClassName() {
        // Destructor code
    }
};
```

**Lecture 09: Placing Class in Separate Files**
```
1-Header File (ClassName.h):


#ifndef CLASSNAME_H
#define CLASSNAME_H

class ClassName {
private:
    // Data members
public:
    // Member functions
};

#endif

```

```
2-Source File (ClassName.cpp):

#include "ClassName.h"

// Member function definitions
```

```
3-Main File (main.cpp):


#include "ClassName.h"
int main() {
    ClassName obj;
    return 0;
}
```

**Lecture 10: Mini Projects**
```
Example Projects:

Project 01: Basic student management system.
Project 02: ATM and Banking system.
```

**Lecture 11: Passing and Returning Objects in Functions**
```
Example:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Example {
public:
    int data;
    Example(int d = 0) : data(d) {}
    Example add(const Example& other) {
        return Example(data + other.data);
    }
};

int main() {
    Example e1(5), e2(10);
    Example e3 = e1.add(e2);
    cout << "Sum: " << e3.data << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Lecture 12: Operator Overloading**

```
Definition: Extending the meaning of an operator for user-defined types.
Syntax:

class Complex {
private:
    double real;
    double imag;
public:
    Complex(double r = 0, double i = 0) : real(r), imag(i) {}
    Complex operator + (const Complex& other) const {
        return Complex(real + other.real, imag + other.imag);
    }
    void display() const {
        cout << real << " + " << imag << "i" << endl;
    }
};
```

**Lecture 13: Inheritance**
```
Types:

Single Inheritance: Derived class inherits from one base class.

Multiple Inheritance: Derived class inherits from more than one base class.

Multilevel Inheritance: Derived class inherits from another derived class.

Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple derived classes inherit from a single 
base class.

Hybrid Inheritance: Combination of two or more types of inheritance.
Example:

class Base {
public:
    void baseFunction() {
        cout << "Base function" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void derivedFunction() {
        cout << "Derived function" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived obj;
    obj.baseFunction();
    obj.derivedFunction();
    return 0;
}
```

**Lecture 14: Polymorphism**
```
Definition: Ability of a function, object, or method to behave differently based 
on context.

Types:
Compile-time (Static) Polymorphism: Function overloading and operator overloading.
Run-time (Dynamic) Polymorphism: Achieved using inheritance and virtual functions.
```

**Lecture 15: Virtual Functions**
```
Definition: Function in a base class that can be overridden in derived class.

Syntax:
class Base {
public:
    virtual void display() {
        cout << "Base class display" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void display() override {
        cout << "Derived class display" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Base* basePtr;
    Derived derivedObj;
    basePtr = &derivedObj;
    basePtr->display(); // Calls Derived class display
    return 0;
}
```
**Lecture 16: Abstract Classes and Pure Virtual Functions**

Definition: Abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and often 
contains pure virtual functions.

Syntax:
```
class AbstractClass {
public:
    virtual void pureVirtualFunction() = 0; // Pure virtual function
};

class ConcreteClass : public AbstractClass {
public:
    void pureVirtualFunction() override {
        cout << "Implementation of pure virtual function" << endl;
    }
};
```

**Lecture 17: Static Members and Functions**

```
Definition: Static members (variables and functions) are shared among 
all instances of a class. They belong to the class itself rather than 
any specific object, meaning there is only one copy of each static 
member, regardless of how many objects are created.

Static Member Variables:

Shared by all objects of the class.
Can be used to keep track of data that should be common to all instances, 
such as a counter for the number of objects created. Declared with the 
static keyword inside the class, but defined outside the class.

```
class Example {
public:
    static int staticVar; // Declaration of static member variable
};

int Example::staticVar = 0; // Definition of static member variable

int main() {
    Example obj1, obj2;
    obj1.staticVar = 5;
    cout << obj2.staticVar << endl; // Outputs 5, since staticVar is shared
    return 0;
}
```
Static Member Functions:

Can access only static member variables and other static member functions.
Do not have a this pointer since they are not called on instances of the class.
Can be called using the class name rather than an object.

class Example {
public:
    static int staticVar;
    static void staticFunction() {
        cout << "Static function, staticVar: " << staticVar << endl;
    }
};

int Example::staticVar = 0; 

int main() {
    Example::staticVar = 10; // Accessing static member variable
    Example::staticFunction(); // Calling static member function
    return 0;
}

Use Cases:

Counter for Objects: Track the number of objects created from a class.

Configuration Settings: Store configuration settings or constants that 
should be the same for all instances.

Utility Functions: Implement utility functions that do not depend on 
object-specific data.
```
**Lecture 18: Friend Functions and Classes**
```
Definition: Friend functions and classes provide a way to grant access to private and protected members of a class to non-member functions or other classes.


Friend Function:

Declared with the friend keyword inside the class.Can access private and 
protected members of the class.Not a member function, 
but has special access privileges.


class Example {
private:
    int data;
public:
    Example(int d) : data(d) {}
    friend void display(const Example& obj); 
};

void display(const Example& obj) {
    cout << "Data: " << obj.data << endl; // Accessing private member
}

int main() {
    Example obj(42);
    display(obj); // Calling friend function
    return 0;
}

Friend Class:

Declared with the friend keyword inside the class.
All member functions of the friend class can access private and protected 
members of the class that declared the friendship.


class Example; // Forward declaration

class FriendClass {
public:
    void display(const Example& obj);
};

class Example {
private:
    int data;
public:
    Example(int d) : data(d) {}
    friend class FriendClass; // Friend class declaration
};

void FriendClass::display(const Example& obj) {
    cout << "Data: " << obj.data << endl; // Accessing private member
}

int main() {
    Example obj(42);
    FriendClass friendObj;
    friendObj.display(obj); // Calling friend class method
    return 0;
}

Use Cases:

Operator Overloading: 
Friend functions are commonly used for operator overloading, especially 
when overloading operators that cannot be member functions 
(e.g., << and >>).

Access to Internal Data: When external functions or classes need to 
access private data without providing public accessors, friend 
functions and classes can be used.
```

**Lecture 19: Templates**
```
Definition: Templates allow writing generic and reusable code by defining 
functions and classes that can operate with any data type.

Syntax:
template <typename T>
T add(T a, T b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    cout << "Int sum: " << add(3, 4) << endl;       // Outputs 7
    cout << "Double sum: " << add(3.5, 2.5) << endl; // Outputs 6.0
    return 0;
}
```
